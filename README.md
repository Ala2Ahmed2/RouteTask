# Product App

The Product App is an Android application designed to fetch and display a list of products from the DummyJSON API. It adheres to the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern, leveraging various Google Android Architecture Components, including LiveData, ViewModel, and Repository patterns. The app also employs Hilt for dependency injection and follows clean architecture principles to ensure maintainability and testability.
